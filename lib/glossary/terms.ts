/**
 * Community shorthand that is NOT a card — set codes ("LoC") and game terms
 * ("EC", "CBI"). Sourced from redemptionccgfl.weebly.com/abbreviations-etc.html
 * and a second, annotated list the site owner compiled.
 *
 * A `[[mention]]` of one of these renders the shorthand the author wrote and
 * explains it on hover or tap, the way a card mention previews its card. That
 * keeps deck-tech voice intact for readers who know the jargon while giving a
 * newcomer a way in.
 *
 * Static on purpose: unlike card aliases ([[project-curated, editable in
 * /admin/catalog]]) this list is the rulebook's vocabulary, not a judgement
 * call about printings, and it changes about once a decade. A table and an
 * editor would be machinery around a constant.
 *
 * Terms are resolved LAST, after cards and card aliases, and a test asserts
 * this list collides with neither — a term that shadows a card could never
 * render, because the card always wins.
