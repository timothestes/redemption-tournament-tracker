/**
 * Brigade swatches.
 *
 * Redemption brigades are named colours, so the palette is semantic rather than
 * categorical — a Crimson bar has to read crimson.
 *
 * This palette deliberately fails the categorical colour-blindness gates, and
 * cannot be fixed by re-stepping. Running the eight good brigades through the
 * validator reports Silver↔Teal at ΔE 4.2 (deutan) and 9.4 with normal vision,
 * flagging Silver below the chroma floor because "reads grey" is precisely what
 * Silver means. Any palette containing Silver, Gray and White has the same
 * problem by construction.
 *
 * So colour is demoted from the encoding to a mnemonic. Every brigade mark is a
 * horizontal bar carrying its own adjacent text label and printed value; length
 * and text hold the data, and the swatch only helps a reader who already knows
 * the brigades find their row faster. That constraint is binding on callers:
 * no brigade pie, no stacked bar read against a detached legend, and no chart
 * where telling two brigades apart depends on seeing their hues.
 *
 * Values are stepped per theme rather than flipped. Four brigades name colours
 * that cannot be rendered literally at readable contrast — White, Black, Gray
 * and Silver — and take the nearest legible neutral instead.
