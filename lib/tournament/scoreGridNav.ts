// Pure navigation + keystroke logic for the desktop score-entry grid.
//
// Kept free of React and DOM so the whole key map is unit-testable. The
// component layer owns focus (a roving tabindex over real <input> cells) and
// persistence; this module only answers "given the current cell and this key,
// where do we go and what do we write?".
//
// Single-digit assumption: tournaments.max_score is a <select> locked to 5 or 7
// (components/ui/TournamentSettings.tsx), so a score is always one character.
// That's what lets a digit keystroke both write AND advance — two keystrokes
// records a whole match.
