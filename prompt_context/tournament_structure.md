Tournament Structure

There are many ways to structure a card tournament, However, the most common structure for a big tournament is called Swiss. In a Swiss style tournament, all players play out a set number of rounds - that is, all players who would like to. Players can drop at any time if they're doing poorly or not having fun. The key is simply that you aren't eliminated by having a bad record.

Sometimes, it's as simple as that; you play some rounds and then earn prizes based on your final standings. Other times there's a cut, such as a cut to a Top 8 Playoff.

Players earn 3 match points for a win, 2 match points for a timed win, 1.5 points for a draw and 0 match points for a loss. You can get an unintentional draw by running out of time in the round, or you can get an intentional draw if both players agree to it. For a number of reasons, it's in everyone's best interest to finish matches in time. You earn more points by winning one round and losing one round than you do by drawing twice. Intentional draws usually only come up in the final rounds of a tournament.

Your standing in the tournament is determined first by your number of match points, and then by "score differential", an internal metric calculated by keeping track of the score difference in your games, which will be explained in more detail later. Thirdly, standings are determined by tiebreakers, which I'll explain a little later. The important thing is that if you have seven match points, you cannot, for any reason, be ranked lower than a player with six match points.

For most normal events, the number of Swiss rounds is based on the number of players in the event. Here's how it's usually done:

5-8 Players = 3 Rounds
9-16 Players = 4 Rounds
17-32 Players = 5 Rounds
33- 64 Players = 6 Rounds 
65-128 Players = 7 Rounds
129-212 Players = 8 Rounds
213- 385 Players = 9 Rounds

This is the number of rounds it would take to have at-most one undefeated player remaining. Although you'll note that we break from this system when the number of players becomes very large.

If a tournament has a cut to Top 8, it's usually structured in such a way that all players with only one loss (we call this an "X-1 Record") will make the Top 8. With one loss and one draw (X-1-1), you might also have a good chance to make the Top 8. Knowing whether or not you'll make it with a draw in the final round can be critical.

Normal Pairings
You cannot be paired against the same player twice in the Swiss rounds. You are paired randomly against others players with the same number of match points, so long as the "same-opponent-twice" restriction is not broken. If there's an odd number of players with a given record, then someone will be picked randomly to be paired up or paired down. In other words, if your record is 2-1 (two wins, one loss), then you will typically be paired against another 2-1 player. Though it's not common, it's also possible to be paired up against 2-0-1 or 3-0 player, or paired down against a 1-1-1 or 1-2 player.

If there's a cut to a single-elimination playoffs (Top 8), you can then be paired against the same opponent for a second time.

Power Pairings
The final round of a tournament is special, and often uses power pairings, which means that players next to one another in the standings get paired. This is, in part, to help make sure that the stakes are the same for both players.

For example, imagine that the players in third and fourth place only need an intentional draw in the final round in order to make the Top 8, but the players in ninth and tenth place need a win in order to make the Top 8. Under normal (randomized) pairings, third place might be paired against ninth place, and the players' goals and incentives would be different. Under power pairings, third and fourth place will be paired (and probably decide to draw) and ninth and tenth place will be paired (and play it out to see who makes the Top 8).

Note that the last round of a tournament is usually paired this way, but not always.

Unusual Cases
Pairings can wind up looking strange when two of these requirements contradict each other. For example, power pairings would have the first place and second place players paired against one another in the final round. But in some cases, they will have already played each other in a previous round, and therefore cannot be paired for a second time.

In this case, the first place player will "look for an opponent" as close as possible in the standings. The second place player is not a valid opponent, so instead they will be paired against the third place player (if possible). Next, the second place player will "look for an opponent." The first place and third place players already have opponents, and maybe the second place and fourth place players have already been paired in a previous round. Now the second place player will be paired against the fifth place player.

In this way, pairings can become unpredictable when many players close to one another in the standings have already been paired. This comes up most often in tournaments that have a very large number of rounds or a relatively small number of players.

Game Score Differential
During the course of a game, players can add points to their game score (which goes up to 5). The differential is simply the difference between your game score and your opponents game score in a game. If you scored 5 and your opponent scored 1 during your first round, you'd have a differntial of +4. And if you scored 2 and your opponent scored 5 in the next round, that would be a -3 differential so you'd have a total differential of +1. These can be usedto determine the rankings of players with the same number of match points

Tiebreakers
Tiebreakers determine the rankings of players with the same number of match points AND the same game differential. Remember that a player with nine match points can never be ranked higher than a player with 10 match points for any reason. Tiebreakers, as the name suggests, only break ties.

The tiebreaker in is based on Opponent Match Win Percentage. You might have heard the same thing referred to as Strength of Schedule in sports or other types of competition. In concept, it means that if you had stronger opponents, then you had to work harder for your wins. In practice, it means that if your opponents won a lot in this particular event, your tiebreakers will be better than if your opponents lost a lot.

Your opponent match win percentage (or OMW) is the average of the win percentage of all of your opponents. If your Round 2 opponent finishes the tournament with a record of 3-3, then they contribute a 50 percent towards your OMW.  If your Round 5 opponent dropped with a record of 2-3, then they contributes a 40 percent towards your OMW (since they don't play Round 6, it doesn't count as a loss). One special rule is that the floor for a particular opponent's contribution is 33 percent, so if there's an unfortunate soul who plays out every round and goes 0-6, they will still contribute a 33 percent to your OMW.

The most important thing to know about OMW is that your tiebreakers will generally be higher if you win the early rounds than if you lose the early rounds. Tiebreakers are complicated and unpredictable, so this is a general trend and not an ironclad rule. However, I would generally expect a player who started out 4-0 and the lost Rounds 5 and 6 to have higher tiebreakers than a player who started out 0-2 and then won Rounds 3 through 6.

In the extremely unlikely case that two players are tied in both match points and OMW, the second and third tiebreakers are Game Win Percentage and Opponent Game Win Percentage. In my experience, the second and third tiebreakers never come up except in tournaments with a very small number or rounds or a very small number of players. I recommend ignoring these completely.

Byes and Tiebreakers
Earning a bye means being given an automatic match win without having to play. You might be given a bye if there are an odd number of players. (After round 1, byes are usually given to players at the bottom of the standings).

When you get a bye, no number is contributed to your OMW for that round. Nonetheless, getting a bye in an early round usually winds up being better for your tiebreakers than if you had beaten a real opponent. Instead of factoring in a player who starts 0-1 into your OMW, you instead get to skip that part and start the equation with your next opponent (who will have also won Round 1). When your opponent gets a bye, it does contribute to your OMW.

Top 8 Playoffs
You've reached the Top 8 of the tournamentâ€“great work! The most common process from here is to do a three-round, single-elimination playoff to determine a winner. You'll play out a seeded bracket with the first place player after the Swiss rounds facing the eighth place player after the Swiss rounds.

Top 8 bracket

Most of the time, the higher seed in each match will get the option to go first in game one of each match, but can also be determined by random chance. This creates a small incentive to perform better in the Swiss rounds. However, traditional wisdom is that you should prioritize making it to the Top 8, rather than going for top positioning. In other words, if you're 4-1 going into the last round, it's probably better to draw into fifth place than to play and risk not making the Top 8 at all.
