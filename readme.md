I'd like you to implement a new feature: the print match slips button.

It should go next to the "print round pairings" button.

Do you know what the concept of a match slip is?

Each player's name is clearly visible

It has a place to write each player's score

Then it has a place for each player to write their signature.

Do you think anything else should be included on a givne match slip

We will want to let the host print it out easily
